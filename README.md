## 2021.11 - 2022.11: Live 2.0

Refactoring and Modularization: The project began by separating the responsibilities of each microservice to ensure efficient and scalable development. Responsibilities were divided so that each database was accessed and managed by a single service, removing global database queries. Additionally, the logical layers within each microservice were separated into controller, service, core, and database layers.

Transition to Microservices: Following a comprehensive redesign of the product, the previous monolithic structure was replaced with a microservices architecture. NestJS was chosen for running these microservices, providing a cohesive and scalable structure for backend services. The adoption of a microservices approach allowed for modular and independent deployment of services, enhancing system resilience and flexibility.

Modernization Efforts: In collaboration with a seasoned system architect, the project aimed to modernize the technology stack and optimize service delivery. TypeORM was leveraged for seamless data management and object-relational mapping, while React and TypeScript were used to develop robust client-side applications.

Server-Side and Backend Improvements: The server-side development was powered by NestJS, offering a rich ecosystem for building scalable applications.

## 2021.09 - 2022.09: Scalable Multi-Tenant Service for a B2B2C Company

The project addressed a critical scalability issue in a B2B2C company, which initially created a separate repository for every customer. This approach led to exponential increases in development, maintenance, and deployment times, making it unsustainable.

Problem:

- Each new customer required a dedicated repository.
- Growing complexity slowed development and deployment.
- Maintenance became increasingly resource-intensive.

Solution:
A multi-tenant architecture was implemented to enable multiple customers to use a single service while maintaining distinct setups. Key steps included:

   - While functional, this approach led to high RAM usage and slower response times.
2. Optimized Multi-Tenant Design
   - Preloaded all customer configurations during service startup.
   - Clients specified their customer ID in MQTT request topics to enable tailored setups.
   - This reduced resource usage and improved response times.
3. Custom Business Logic for Customers
   - Developed a "nano-service" engine and editor to create, store, and assign workflows.
   - Allowed customers to have unique workflows within the same shared service.

Key Achievements:

- Scalability: A single multi-tenant service replaced individual customer repositories.
- Performance: Preloaded configurations and streamlined MQTT communication reduced response times.
- Flexibility: The nano-service engine enabled customer-specific workflows without duplicating services.
- Efficiency: Maintenance and deployment times were significantly reduced.

Outcomes:

## 2021.11 - 2022.06: Central User Database

Project Overview: This project aimed to address the issues of data redundancy and disorganization in the previous system. The original setup suffered from inefficient storage utilization due to multiple databases managed by different services, which were not coherently designed. To resolve these issues, the project focused on restructuring the user data architecture and transitioning from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, and eventually to Redis, for enhanced efficiency.

Challenges and Solutions: The redundancy in user data was introduced during the initial version of the system, where data was dispersed across multiple databases. The main goal was to centralize this user data into a single, centrally managed database to streamline operations and improve performance. PostgreSQL was chosen over other options like MySQL due to its better fit for the project's needs. The transition from a NoSQL (MongoDB) to an SQL (PostgreSQL) database required introducing a new data structure, where documents were split into well-designed tables. This restructuring also created opportunities for new features and enhanced the system's overall efficiency.

Technical Evolution: The project explored moving core business logic into SQL embedded functions to leverage PostgreSQL's capabilities. Additionally, Redis was adopted later on to further improve efficiency. A significant aspect of this transition was the focus on creating a very fast core service to manage the centralized user database. The introduction of a new data architecture and the shift to SQL databases marked a critical step in optimizing the system's performance and ensuring more organized data management.

## 2022.01 - 2022.04: Core Packages

Project Overview: This project aimed to eliminate code duplication and improve scalability by restructuring the product into packages. Initially, the product contained significant code redundancy, with separate repositories created for each customer, which complicated maintenance and hindered scalability.

Refactoring Efforts: The solution involved creating an npm Angular module library, extracting different modules so that main applications could selectively utilize them. This approach was mirrored on the backend with an npm library comprising NestJS modules used by various services connected to Angular applications.

Introduction of Microservices: Following a complete product redesign, the initial repositories and packages were abandoned in favor of microservices with distinct functions. A core npm package was established to consolidate all essential tools used by these microservices. The core package's version number indicated the overall product version, ensuring consistency.

Further Modularization: As the project evolved, the core package was eventually divided into multiple packages. One package retained core functions while others extracted data model interfaces, schemas, and types, facilitating shared interface definitions across both backend and frontend. This modularization ensured better maintainability, scalability, and efficient development processes.

By refactoring the product into well-defined packages and introducing microservices, the project significantly improved the architecture, making it more scalable and easier to maintain.

Project Overview: The project revolves around the software development and refinement of an administrative platform initially developed at a rapid pace. This swift development necessitated a comprehensive phase of debugging and refinement to ensure system stability and functionality. Alongside this, customer-driven enhancements were identified and integrated into the existing system to meet user needs and expectations.

Development and Enhancements: A significant aspect of the project was the creation of a comprehensive software developers handbook. This handbook was designed to aid new developers in onboarding smoothly and established crucial standards such as code style, commit message, and coding conventions. The introduction of socket communication marked a technical evolution, replacing the traditional HTTP communication method and enhancing system efficiency.

Stakeholder Collaboration: Throughout the project, there was regular and close collaboration with the CEO, who conveyed feature requests from customers. These meetings, held several times a week, ensured that customer feedback was promptly addressed and integrated into the platform. By providing estimated timeframes (ETAs) and continuous feedback on these requests, the development process remained aligned with customer needs and business goals.

Project Outcomes: This structured approach to refining and enhancing the administrative platform not only improved its functionality and user experience but also established a robust framework for future development. The combination of rigorous debugging, systematic documentation, and responsive integration of customer feedback set the foundation for a scalable and efficient administrative platform.

Project Contribution: Data Visualization Developer

Project Aim:
The growth team required a comprehensive dashboard to visualize user activity and behavioral data, which would serve as a foundation for deriving insights and informing strategic business decisions.

Solution Delivered:
I started the development of a sophisticated dashboard that provides a visual representation of user engagement and patterns. My initial task involved [scripting a data transformation](https://github.com/entazis/user-activity-data-preparer) process that converted raw data from MongoDB into a structured format suitable for chart plotting. This enabled the seamless integration of complex datasets into the dashboard, allowing for intuitive analysis and reporting.

Furthermore, I integrated Google Analytics with the dashboard, providing access to key performance indicators such as page views and other relevant metrics. This integration offered a holistic view of user interactions and website performance, thereby enhancing the growth team's ability to make data-driven decisions.

The successful implementation of this dashboard has empowered the company with actionable insights, optimizing its approach to user engagement and growth strategy.

## 2018.01 - 2018.02: [Automatic Slack Registration](https://github.com/entazis/automatic-slack-registration)

Project Objective:
The online programming school sought to expand its Slack-based community by simplifying the registration process. The goal was to eliminate the need for users to navigate a lengthy and unfamiliar form-filling procedure.

Technical Solution:
I developed a Node.js application utilizing Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, to automate the registration process. The application initially registers using a placeholder email address and subsequently updates the registration to the user's actual email address. As a result, the user receives an email prompting them to set a new password, thereby granting them immediate access to the community's Slack workspace without the hassle of manual form submission.

## 2017.06 - 2018.01: [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/entazis/churnacle-node)

Project Goal:
CodeBerry Programming School required a predictive system to identify users at risk of churning, enabling proactive engagement to retain them.

Solution Developed:

- A predictive analytics framework using R Studio hosted on an AWS server.
- Prepared datasets for analysis.
- Trained machine learning models to identify patterns indicative of user churn.
- Conducted exploratory experiments with neural networks to enhance predictive accuracy.

The result was a predictive model that significantly outperformed random selection, correctly identifying users likely to churn with a two-thirds accuracy rate. However, the model's performance was constrained by the limited amount of training data available from the company.

In addition to the analytics work, I developed a Node.js application that automated the process of sending retention-focused emails through Intercom to the users identified by the model as at risk of churning.

Outcome:
The project delivered a functional predictive system that provided actionable insights, allowing CodeBerry Programming School to engage with users more effectively and reduce churn rates.

## 2017.12 - 2018.01: [Rapstar](https://github.com/entazis/rapstar-project) - Generating hip-hop lyrics using neural networks

Project Description:
As a personal endeavor during my university years, I embarked on an experimental project to create an autonomous rap lyricist. Inspired by a Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) project I discovered on GitHub, my goal was to train a neural network to generate hip-hop lyrics independently.

Technical Execution:
I developed a web scraper to collect a substantial corpus of Hungarian hip-hop lyrics from a dedicated lyrics website. After performing the necessary data cleaning to refine the dataset, I initiated the training process for the RNN with these texts.

Outcome:
The project's end result was a rap-bot that produced text resembling coherent Hungarian lyrics, although the content lacked a meaningful sense. It became evident that achieving the creation of authentic and intelligent lyrics would require a more extensive dataset and prolonged training period.
