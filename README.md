### 2021.11 - 2022.06: Central User Database

Project Overview: This project aimed to address the issues of data redundancy and disorganization in the previous system. The original setup suffered from inefficient storage utilization due to multiple databases managed by different services, which were not coherently designed. To resolve these issues, the project focused on restructuring the user data architecture and transitioning from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, and eventually to Redis, for enhanced efficiency.

Challenges and Solutions: The redundancy in user data was introduced during the initial version of the system, where data was dispersed across multiple databases. The main goal was to centralize this user data into a single, centrally managed database to streamline operations and improve performance. PostgreSQL was chosen over other options like MySQL due to its better fit for the project's needs. The transition from a NoSQL (MongoDB) to an SQL (PostgreSQL) database required introducing a new data structure, where documents were split into well-designed tables. This restructuring also created opportunities for new features and enhanced the system's overall efficiency.

Technical Evolution: The project explored moving core business logic into SQL embedded functions to leverage PostgreSQL's capabilities. Additionally, Redis was adopted later on to further improve efficiency. A significant aspect of this transition was the focus on creating a very fast core service to manage the centralized user database. The introduction of a new data architecture and the shift to SQL databases marked a critical step in optimizing the system's performance and ensuring more organized data management.

**Skills:** TypeORM · NestJS · Node.js · PostgreSQL · SQL · REST APIs

### 2022.01 - 2022.04: Core Packages

Project Overview: This project aimed to eliminate code duplication and improve scalability by restructuring the product into packages. Initially, the product contained significant code redundancy, with separate repositories created for each customer, which complicated maintenance and hindered scalability.

Refactoring Efforts: The solution involved creating an npm Angular module library, extracting different modules so that main applications could selectively utilize them. This approach was mirrored on the backend with an npm library comprising NestJS modules used by various services connected to Angular applications.

Introduction of Microservices: Following a complete product redesign, the initial repositories and packages were abandoned in favor of microservices with distinct functions. A core npm package was established to consolidate all essential tools used by these microservices. The core package's version number indicated the overall product version, ensuring consistency.

Further Modularization: As the project evolved, the core package was eventually divided into multiple packages. One package retained core functions while others extracted data model interfaces, schemas, and types, facilitating shared interface definitions across both backend and frontend. This modularization ensured better maintainability, scalability, and efficient development processes.

By refactoring the product into well-defined packages and introducing microservices, the project significantly improved the architecture, making it more scalable and easier to maintain.
