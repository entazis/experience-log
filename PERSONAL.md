## About

I've been building backend systems and leading engineering teams for over 7 years, mostly in fast-moving startup environments. I specialize in making systems that can handle growth—from designing microservices architectures to managing distributed teams across time zones.

Recently, I've been deep into AI-assisted development workflows, which has genuinely changed how we work (we're talking 5x productivity gains on large-scale refactoring). I led the consolidation of 15+ repositories into a single monorepo at BeamLive, set up proper deployment protocols, and spent a lot of time thinking about how to make code maintainable when your team is growing fast.

My sweet spot is backend engineering with Node.js/TypeScript, Redis, and microservices, but I've also worn the DevOps and team lead hats enough to know what actually matters in production.

## Experience

### [BeamLive](https://beam.live)

#### 2025.01 - Present: Tech Lead

When I stepped into the tech lead role, we had 15+ separate repositories that made coordinating changes a nightmare. I spent the first few months orchestrating a migration to Beam v2.2 and consolidating everything into a single monorepo—preserving over 6,600 commits in the process because version history matters.

The biggest game-changer has been integrating AI into our development workflow. I set up MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and established guidelines for using AI agents in code review, refactoring, and documentation. The results have been dramatic: we're seeing genuine 5x productivity improvements on large migration tasks. Not hype—actual measured time savings.

I'm currently managing a distributed team of engineers across different time zones, which means I've had to get good at async communication. Daily Slack stand-ups, weekly technical deep-dives, and a lot of documentation. I also introduced Prometheus for monitoring, automated our schema generation, and set up deployment protocols with proper security reviews—stuff that sounds boring but saves you when things go wrong at 2 AM.

On the technical side, I built a dynamic model loading system that generates runtime JSON schemas and automates database indexes, triggers, and validations. It's cut down schema maintenance time significantly and made our data models way more consistent across services.

**Skills:** Leadership · Microservices · NestJS · Redis · TypeScript · AI Agents · MCP · Prometheus

#### 2022.02 - 2024.12: Senior Software Engineer

I joined BeamLive when the product was going through a major architectural shift. One of my first big projects was building a nano-service engine—essentially a runtime environment where we could deploy custom business logic without taking down the entire system. This was crucial for our B2B2C model where different clients needed different features.

The migration from PostgreSQL to Redis and from HTTP to MQTT was painful but necessary. We were hitting performance walls with the old stack, and the new setup cut response times by 40%. I also set up Redis clustering for fault tolerance and built out proper database replication and sharding.

Testing was virtually non-existent when I arrived, which made me nervous. I built a testing framework around Jest and wrote integration tests that could handle our MQTT request/response patterns. Got test coverage up by 70%, which saved us countless times when refactoring.

Some other highlights: built a real-time location service with geofencing using Tile38, created a notification engine with template support, set up MQTT load balancing that actually simplified our code (30% reduction), and built configurable admin tools that cut maintenance time in half. Also worked on transaction handling, dynamic database indexing, and even a spreadsheet-style calculator for pricing logic.

**Skills:** TypeScript · NestJS · Redis · Jest · Microservices · Multi-Tenant Management · Message Queue

#### 2020.08 - 2022.01: Full Stack Software Developer & Product Owner

This was my entry point to BeamLive, working on the admin platform and basically anything that needed doing. I spent a lot of time talking directly with the CEO about customer feature requests—sometimes multiple times a week—and translating those into actual implementations.

The codebase was growing fast and getting messy, so I kicked off a redesign effort focused on performance and scalability. Extracted core components into reusable modules, which improved code quality by about 40% and made the codebase much easier to navigate. Also worked across the full stack here—NestJS and TypeScript on the backend, Angular and React on the frontend.

**Skills:** NestJS · TypeScript · MongoDB · PostgreSQL · Redis · Angular · React · MQTT

### [CodeBerry Programming School](https://codeberryschool.com/)

#### 2018.10 - 2020.08: Software Developer

At CodeBerry, I was the go-to person for building features across their online programming school platform. I rebuilt their landing pages and payment flow (moving from multi-page to a single-page app), implemented a badge system for gamification, and set up automated email triggers to keep students engaged.

Also built various web scrapers for data collection, worked on UX improvements throughout the platform, and generally helped keep their web infrastructure running smoothly. It was a good mix of frontend and backend work with Node.js, MongoDB, React, and GraphQL.

**Skills:** Node.js · MongoDB · GraphQL · API Development · Docker · JavaScript · React.js

#### 2018.06 - 2020.08: Data Analyst

Wore the data analyst hat alongside development work. Set up and configured Google Analytics, built dashboards in Google Data Studio, and dug through data from MongoDB, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads to figure out what was actually working.

Tracked the full funnel with AARRR metrics (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue) and ran statistical analyses on ad campaigns to optimize spend across channels. The company had a lot of data but wasn't using it effectively—my job was to make it actionable.

**Skills:** Data Analytics · MongoDB · Google Data Studio · Google Analytics

#### 2018.09 - 2019.03: Code Mentor

Mentored students through web development projects, mostly helping them get unstuck on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.

**Skills:** CSS · JavaScript · HTML

#### 2017.06 - 2018.06: Data Scientist Intern and Machine Learning Engineer

My first real job in tech. Built machine learning models to predict customer churn using R and trained neural networks to improve accuracy. The models beat random selection by a solid margin (about 2/3 accuracy), though we were limited by the amount of training data available.

Also built a Node.js service that automatically sent retention emails to at-risk users identified by the model.

**Skills:** Machine Learning · Node.js · MongoDB · Data Analytics · R · Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Projects

### 2025.09: Deployment Protocol & Security Hardening

After dealing with one too many production incidents, I pushed for standardizing our deployment process. Set up mandatory code reviews, added a staging environment, and wrote documentation that people actually follow. Every deployment now requires technical and security reviews before hitting production.

It's the kind of boring infrastructure work that nobody notices until it saves your ass at 2 AM.

**Skills:** DevOps · Security · CI/CD · Release Management · GitHub · Policy Design

### 2025.08: MCP Server Integration

Set up Model-Context Protocol servers so AI agents could actually talk to our services. Started experimenting with autonomous agents for testing and routine dev tasks. It's early days, but the foundation is there for some really interesting workflow automation.

**Skills:** AI Agents · MCP · API Integration · Automation · Protocol Design

### 2025.07 - 2025.10: Dynamic Model Loading & Schema Generation

We had different schema definitions scattered across services with no single source of truth. Built a system that generates JSON schemas at runtime and automatically creates database indexes, triggers, and validations based on unified metadata.

The implementation meant merging all our entity model types and setting up dynamic loading from our config database. Maintenance time dropped significantly and we finally have consistency across services.

**Skills:** JSON Schema · Runtime Validation · NestJS · TypeScript · Automation · Database Indexing · Schema Design · Redis · Metadata Management

### 2025.07 - 2025.09: Beam Live Monorepo & DevOps Ecosystem

The monorepo migration was a multi-month effort. Moved 15+ repositories into a single codebase while preserving all 6,674 commits—because losing history is unacceptable. AI agents were crucial here; they handled a lot of the tedious refactoring work and we measured about a 5x productivity boost on the migration tasks.

Organized everything into core services, shared packages, and apps with clean boundaries. Added Prometheus for monitoring and wrote extensive documentation on using AI agents with our codebase. Development is way smoother now that everyone's working in the same repo.

**Skills:** Monorepo · DevOps · Prometheus · AI Agents · NestJS · TypeScript · GitHub Actions · CI/CD

### 2025.03 - 2025.08: Beam v2.2 Migration & System Stabilization

Led the migration of all our core services to v2.2—connector, authenticator, notification, central user database, the works. This wasn't just a version bump; we completely overhauled our testing approach. Built a testing framework and debug tools, then wrote 20+ integration tests for each service.

Also established the AI-assisted development guidelines that are now part of our workflow and got daily stand-ups running for the team. The migration took months, but we came out with much better stability and test coverage.

**Skills:** Microservices · NestJS · Redis · CI/CD · Testing Automation · Integration Testing · Jest

### 2025.02 - 2025.10: AI-Assisted Development & Team Management

Managing a distributed team of 5 developers while experimenting with AI tools has been interesting. Got everyone set up with Cursor subscriptions, established budgets and guidelines for AI usage, and trained the team on how to actually use these tools effectively (it's not just autocomplete).

We now use AI for code review, automated debugging, and routine refactoring. I run shaping meetings, write technical reports for stakeholders, and spend a fair amount of time mentoring developers. The productivity gains are real—and measurable—but it required intentional process changes.

**Skills:** Leadership · AI Tooling · Remote Team Management · Process Automation · Mentorship · Code Review

### 2024.03 - 2024.10: Beam CI/CD and Tests

We were testing everything manually, which was insane. I pushed for automated testing despite some resistance from management and built out a CI/CD pipeline that runs on every PR: spins up Redis and MQTT, builds the repo, runs the app, executes integration tests.

The tricky part was building a testing framework that could handle our MQTT request/response patterns. Once it was in place, we finally had automated validation for all our services. Made deployments way less stressful.

**Skills:** Integration Testing · Jest · GitHub · Redis

### 2022.11 - 2024.10: Live 2.2

This was a major restructuring effort that touched everything. Migrated from Postgres to Redis for better performance, built out a proper multi-tenant architecture where each customer could have custom logic through nano-services, and used JSON schemas to validate data structures per organization.

On the management side, I was handling 25-30 repositories—keeping track of versions, coordinating refactors, and making sure everything stayed in sync. Spent time mediating conflicts between management and developers (and between developers), interviewing and onboarding new team members, and mentoring junior devs.

I also took ownership of all backend services, set development conventions, built tooling, and had regular strategy discussions with the CEO about resource needs. It was a lot of system design, architectural decisions, and making sure we could actually scale.

**Skills:** NestJS · Redis · TypeScript · Multi-Tenant Management · JSON Schema · B2B2C · Microservices

### 2022.04 - 2024.03: Evolution of Location Service and Geofence Management

Started with a basic location storage system using MongoDB and HTTP that couldn't handle real-time tracking. Moved to Redis with geo hashes, but that still wasn't cutting it for complex geofencing scenarios.

Eventually rewrote the whole thing. Decoupled location processing into its own service, added RediSearch for better queries with polygon support, and integrated Tile38—a specialized geospatial database—for real-time geofencing and MQTT-based alerts. Replaced redundant data storage with meta indices and phased out the legacy MongoDB and Redis geoquery systems.

End result: a proper real-time location service that can handle dynamic geofences (like tracking buses in real-time), direct device-to-service communication, and complex IoT ecosystems. Also got partial time-based geofence conditions working with scheduled tasks.

**Skills:** Node.js · NestJS · Redis · Tile38 · Geofencing · MQTT · GeoJSON

### 2023.11 - 2024.01: Horizontal Scaling

First attempt at horizontal scaling involved message queues (npm bull) between controllers and services. It worked but was complicated—we effectively doubled our application instances.

The second version was much cleaner: dropped the separate controller/service split and used MQTT v5 shared subscriptions directly for load balancing. Way simpler code and it just uses round-robin. Should have started with this approach.

**Skills:** Message Queue · MQTT · Load Balancing

### 2023.04 - 2023.07: Client Code Reduction

Everything was written in JavaScript with inconsistent data structures. I pushed to migrate all services to TypeScript, which gave us type safety and made refactoring way less scary. Created shared type definitions in an npm package that both server and client could use.

We also did a React Native proof of concept to unify our stack—server, database, browser, and mobile all using TypeScript. Budget didn't allow for separate iOS and Android developers, so this let us share code across platforms and move faster with a smaller team.

**Skills:** React · npm · JavaScript · TypeScript

### 2023.01 - 2023.06: Programmable Admin Platform

Built a programmable admin platform where the React client loads its configuration from the server at runtime. Each editor spins up a nano-service workflow that communicates in real-time with the frontend. The backend can modify the UI on the fly by sending requests, and we have a full editor for creating, testing, and debugging these workflows.

It's essentially a low-code platform for building admin tools without deploying new code every time someone wants a new feature.

**Skills:** React · Redis · MQTT · TypeScript · NestJS

### 2022.08 - 2023.02: Nano-Service Engine and Editor

The previous workflow system was too complex—even our own developers struggled with it. Beam needed a way for customers to customize business logic without us writing custom code for every client.

I built a nano-service engine that separates core backend functionality from customizable business logic. Added TypeScript support to the workflow editor, built proper debugging tools, and optimized performance so the server could handle thousands of active workflows simultaneously. Also created an "actionflow" system for managing organization-specific UI scripts.

It's not perfect, but it solved the immediate problem of allowing customization at scale.

**Skills:** Microservices · NestJS · Redis · TypeScript

### 2021.11 - 2022.11: Live 2.0

Complete architectural overhaul from monolith to microservices. Worked with a system architect to redesign everything—each microservice got clear responsibility boundaries, proper layering (controller/service/core/database), and each database was managed by a single service.

Moved to NestJS for the backend, TypeORM for data management, React and TypeScript for the frontend. The goal was modularity and independent deployments, which we achieved. It was a lot of work but set us up for actual scalability.

**Skills:** Microservices · TypeORM · NestJS · Node.js · React · PostgreSQL · TypeScript

### 2021.09 - 2022.09: Scalable Multi-Tenant Service for a B2B2C Company

We had a serious scalability problem: every new customer got their own repository. As we grew, this became completely unsustainable—deployment and maintenance times were exploding.

My first attempt at multi-tenancy used NestJS's built-in approach, creating new service instances per request. It worked but killed performance with high RAM usage. The second iteration was much better: preload all customer configs at startup, and let clients specify their customer ID in MQTT topics. Way faster and way less resource-intensive.

Also built the nano-service engine during this project, which let customers have custom workflows without us duplicating services. Went from dozens of repositories to a single multi-tenant service.

**Skills:** NestJS · MQTT · Microservices · Multi-Tenant Management · TypeScript · Redis · PostgreSQL

### 2021.11 - 2022.06: Central User Database

User data was scattered across multiple databases with tons of redundancy. I centralized everything into a single database, migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL (and later to Redis for certain operations).

The MongoDB-to-SQL transition meant redesigning the entire data structure—splitting documents into properly normalized tables. Also experimented with moving some business logic into SQL functions to leverage PostgreSQL's capabilities. The result was a fast, centralized user database service with way better data organization.

**Skills:** TypeORM · NestJS · Node.js · PostgreSQL · SQL · REST APIs

### 2022.01 - 2022.04: Core Packages

Too much duplicated code across repositories. Started by creating npm packages—an Angular module library for the frontend and a NestJS module library for the backend—so we could reuse code instead of copy-pasting.

When we moved to microservices, I created a core npm package with all the shared tooling. Later split that into multiple packages: one for core functions, others for data models, schemas, and types that could be shared between backend and frontend. Made maintenance way easier.

**Skills:** React · Angular · NestJS · TypeScript · npm

### 2020.08 - 2021.03: Admin Platform

The admin platform was built fast and needed serious cleanup. Spent months debugging, refining, and adding customer-requested features. Also wrote a developer handbook to standardize code style, commit messages, and coding conventions for new team members.

Replaced HTTP with socket communication for better real-time capabilities. Had regular meetings with the CEO about feature requests—sometimes multiple times a week—and kept turning those into working features.

**Skills:** NestJS · MongoDB · Node.js · Angular · REST APIs · React.js

### 2019.03 - 2020.08: [Google Ads Exporter](https://github.com/entazis/google-ads-exporter)

Built a Google Script that runs on a schedule to export Google Ads campaign data (spend, conversions, etc.) into a Google Sheet for easier reporting.

**Skills:** Google Ads · Data Analytics · Google Apps Script · JavaScript

### 2019.11 - 2019.12: [Landing page for a customer](https://github.com/entazis/sypico-landing)

Built a responsive landing page for a client from custom designs.

**Skills:** React · Node.js · JavaScript · CSS · HTML

### 2019.09 - 2019.10: [Optimizing the website of a customer](https://github.com/entazis/robotmaster-next)

Client's server-side React setup was misconfigured—the whole app reloaded on every navigation, defeating the purpose of SSR and SPA. Fixed the [SSR implementation](https://github.com/entazis/robotmaster-ssr) and then migrated to Next.js for static rendering, which made the site much faster.

**Skills:** Next.js

### 2019.01 - 2019.07: [Landing Page of Programming School](https://github.com/entazis/landing-page-v2)

Migrated CodeBerry's landing page from WordPress to a custom app. Added dynamic content, localization, database integration, and UTM tracking. Did A/B testing on some features and optimized for SEO. Eventually converted the whole site to static files for better performance.

**Skills:** Node.js · JavaScript · A/B Testing · CSS · HTML

### 2019.04 - 2019.06: [Automatic Email Reports (triggers)](https://github.com/entazis/email-triggers)

Built an automated email system to keep students engaged. The server queries the database daily/weekly for user activity and sends personalized emails based on whether they were active yesterday, in the last week, or exactly a week ago. Designed the HTML templates too.

**Skills:** MongoDB · Node.js · JavaScript

### 2019.03 - 2019.04: [Facebook Ads Exporter](https://github.com/entazis/facebook-ads-exporter)

Same concept as the Google Ads exporter but for Facebook. Found an open-source tool, forked it, and customized it to export Facebook Ads data into Google Sheets.

**Skills:** Data Analytics · Google Apps Script · Facebook Ads · Google Sheets

### 2019.03 - 2019.04: Google Analytics Dashboard

Set up Google Analytics for the company and standardized UTM tagging so they could actually use all their data for decision-making.

**Skills:** Data Analytics · Data Science

### 2019.01 - 2019.03: [Badges (gamification)](https://github.com/entazis/badges-module)

Built the server-side logic for a badge system—tracked user achievements and unlocked badges based on specific criteria. Did some minor client-side work to integrate it smoothly.

**Skills:** API Development · MongoDB · Node.js · JavaScript · REST APIs

### 2018.11 - 2019.02: Payment Page of Programming School

Rebuilt CodeBerry's multi-page payment system as a single-page app. Added client and server-side validation, internationalization for multiple languages, and a chat bubble for support. Lots of small UX improvements.

**Skills:** Node.js · JavaScript · REST APIs

### 2018.07 - 2018.08: Growth Dashboard (AARRR metrics)

Built a dashboard for the growth team to visualize AARRR metrics and user behavior. [Wrote a Python script](https://github.com/entazis/user-activity-data-preparer) to transform raw MongoDB data into chart-ready format and integrated Google Analytics for page views and other KPIs.

**Skills:** Data Analytics · Python · Google Analytics

### 2018.07 - 2018.07: [Power Plant Dropout Web Scraper](https://github.com/entazis/power-plant-dropout-scraper)

Built a web scraper to monitor power plant dropouts and save the data to CSV for an alert system.

**Skills:** Python · Git

### 2018.07 - 2018.07: [Weather Service Data Fix](https://github.com/entazis/weather-service-data-fix)

The company had incomplete weather data with missing timestamps that was crashing their system. Wrote a script to fill gaps with estimated data and added tests to verify it worked.

**Skills:** Python · Git

### 2018.01 - 2018.02: [Automatic Slack Registration](https://github.com/entazis/automatic-slack-registration)

Built a Node.js app using Puppeteer to automate Slack registration for CodeBerry's community. It registers with a temp email, then updates to the user's real email, so they just get a password-reset email instead of dealing with forms.

**Skills:** Node.js · Git · Slack

### 2017.06 - 2018.01: [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/entazis/churnacle-node)

Built a machine learning system to predict which students would churn. Trained models in R on an AWS server, experimented with neural networks, and got about 2/3 accuracy (limited by available training data). Also built a Node.js app to automatically send retention emails via Intercom to at-risk users.

**Skills:** Deep Learning · Artificial Intelligence (AI) · Machine Learning · R · Docker

### 2017.12 - 2018.01: [Rapstar](https://github.com/entazis/rapstar-project) - Generating hip-hop lyrics using neural networks

Personal project during university. Scraped Hungarian hip-hop lyrics, cleaned the data, and trained an RNN to generate rap lyrics. The output looked like Hungarian text but didn't really make sense—would have needed way more training data and time to get something actually good.

### 2015.02 - 2015.05: Teachable Remote Controller

University project where I built a programmable IR remote from scratch. Designed the circuit, soldered all the components, wrote the C firmware for the microcontroller, and implemented a recording system so it could learn signals from other remotes. It worked—you could teach it any IR command and it would replay it.

**Skills:** Embedded Systems · C Programming · Microcontrollers · Circuit Design · Infrared Communication · Soldering · Hardware Prototyping
